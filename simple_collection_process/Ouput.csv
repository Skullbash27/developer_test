1,What the DOL’s Fiduciary Rule Means Now and What You Can Do About It,2017-11-21T10:52:46+00:00,"Tuesday, November 21st, 2017 at 10:52 am.",Kim Shaw Elliott,http://ifpartners.com/dols-fiduciary-rule-means-now-can/,"You have heard much about the results of the new definition of fiduciary released by the Department of Labor (“DOL”). Few pieces of regulation have been as long-awaited, as hotly contested, or as little understood. Even the timing of the rule’s provisions requires a scoresheet. After years of planning, proposed rules and withdrawn rules, the DOL released the “final” rule to be effective June 7, 2016, but its provisions were not to be applicable until April 10, 2017. Following the start of the Trump Administration, the applicability date of the new definition was extended to June 9, 2017, with many of the more controversial provisions not becoming “applicable” until July 1, 2019. We all wait on the edge of our seats to learn what new form the rule may take when it emerges from the delay. Highlights of what the new rule means In issuing this ground-breaking regulation and later pronouncements, the DOL: 1. Expanded the definition of fiduciary. Despite some common misconceptions, nothing has changed from the new rule’s definition of fiduciary. Anyone who is paid to provide investment advice is a fiduciary and must act in the best interest of the customer. This is true whenever the advice is provided to a plan, an IRA, HSA or similar IRA-like accounts. In general, this means that the fiduciary must hold the customer’s interest above his or her own, avoiding all conflicts of interest and receiving only reasonable compensation. A fiduciary must act prudently, essentially meaning that the fiduciary must exercise appropriate due diligence and follow a reasonable process in making decisions. Just as before, a reasonable process does not require perfection in decision-making; it does require collecting facts, identifying options, giving sound consideration to available choices and maintaining a good record of the process. 2. Clarified that commissions and payments from third parties create prohibited conflicts of interest. Only “level” compensation is conflict free. Commissions have been long-entrenched as traditional forms of compensation for brokerage sales. Commissions are transaction-based, meaning that a commission is paid every time a trade is made and there is no compensation if a trade is not made. Commissions can vary, based upon the type of security that a customer purchases. Bonds may pay different commissions than stocks and one mutual fund may pay more than what another equally appropriate mutual fund might pay. This means that a broker-dealer registered representative could recommend a particular investment that pays him or herself more than what another equally appropriate investment might pay. The DOL believes that this creates an inherent conflict of interest. Since the transactions are conflicted, they are prohibited and subject to substantial penalties. This long-established rule created extensive consternation among the broker dealer community. Registered investment advisers and their investment advisor representatives are traditionally paid asset-based fees or fixed dollar amounts. These fees are owed regardless of the number of transactions that the advisor recommends be made and regardless of which investments are recommended. Since compensation to the advisor does not vary with the investment recommendation, it is known as “level” compensation. 3. Created new exemptions to permit conflicted compensation, subject to specified conditions. In response to thousands of complaints requesting relief for traditional forms of brokerage compensation, the DOL conceded in a very clever way. It spoke to the industry, saying that it could continue to pay conflicted forms of compensation, so long as the fiduciary rendering advice meets specified conditions and enters into a Best Interest Contract. This contract is the dreaded BIC. The fiduciary advisor must make lengthy disclosures, commit to acting in the client’s best interest, and maintain policies and procedures to ensure that the advice remains conflict-free. This representation is enforceable in state court. Short forms of the exemption were created for ERISA plans and for the “Level Fee Fiduciary.” 4. Postponed enforcement while the rule is reconsidered; Impartial Conduct Standard survives. The BIC portion of the rule has been delayed, likely until 2019, or it may be substantially revised or even dropped. Until then, broad transitional relief is available. No BIC contract, written policies and procedures or private right to sue is mandated. The only requirement to avail oneself of the transition exemption is to satisfy the Impartial Conduct Standard. It requires that an advisor: Act in the best interest of the client Receive no more than reasonable compensation, and Make no misrepresentations about services and fees. On its face, this looks simple. Remember: no formal written policies, procedures or contracts are required. Closer evaluation reveals some gaps, however. How do you know you are acting in the best interest of a client if you have no policies or procedures to guide you? Have you properly disclosed any potential conflicts of interest? Can you tell what is reasonable compensation for services without benchmarking other fees? Might a client misunderstand, or worse, believe that you may have misrepresented about what services you will perform, if you do not describe those services in a well- written, easy to read, agreement? While not required, having clear policies and procedures, benchmarking your fees and maintaining clearly understandable contracts simply makes sense. Each is a best practice that is likely to increase understanding among parties and to produce happy results. This is nothing new. What IFP advisors should do now. What we can do now is simply update sound, time-proven practices. Our new approaches help you: 1. Follow a prudent process to meet the requirements of the transitional relief. Our new forms help chart a path for how to act in the client’s best interest. We have reviewed our policies and procedures for services to retirement plans and will soon release updated versions. 2. Update your agreements. The new rule requires that you acknowledge your status as an ERISA fiduciary when delivering advice to a plan, IRA or IRA-like account. Our retirement plan agreements have always admitted fiduciary status when providing investment advice and our IAA has been updated to do so for IRAs. Hopefully, you find these disclosures to be written in plain, simple-to-understand English. 3. Confirm that fiduciary activity is covered under your errors and omissions insurance coverage. Many policies exclude this coverage, but the E&O policy provided through LPL specifically includes fiduciary activity. Investment advisor representatives that are not registered with LPL, but registered with IFP are not covered under the LPL policy and should obtain their own E&O policies. They need to confirm with their E&O provider whether a special endorsement is required to include fiduciary activity. Review how service to IRAs will be treated under your separate policies. 4. Understand all forms of compensation you might receive and consider whether fee-based advisory is the better option. Evaluate any form of unlevel compensation you might currently receive such as commissions and third party. Consider whether brokerage accounts continue to best meet your client’s interests, compared to the potential conflicts and disclosures they might require. Review whether the level fee structure of the RIA is a better arrangement and whether you should convert those accounts. 5. Document your reasons to recommend any rollover or a conversion from a brokerage account to an advisory account. Use our new forms to detail what reasons best meet your client’s needs. The forms themselves provide an outline for your discussion with the client as well as a record of what choices the client makes. Despite the changes and effects of the DOL’s new rule, it has provided a new opportunity to document best practices and to help you better inform your clients.

2,Retaining Clients Through a Transition,2017-10-31T11:54:06+00:00,"Tuesday, October 31st, 2017 at 11:54 am.",Ned Van Riper,http://ifpartners.com/retaining-clients-transition/,"If you have been in the industry long enough, you’ve heard horror stories about advisors changing firms or breaking away, only to lose a majority of their clients. This story is the same across numerous channels, including wirehouse, independent, and insurance-based or bank broker-dealer-affiliated advisors. These stories are sometimes fabricated by branch managers to scare everyone straight (I am thinking of my former wirehouse!) and sometimes they are true. Exploring the Truths Let’s start by exploring the cases that are true. It’s typically obvious why this happens. An advisor is not happy with their practice’s growth and often is pressured by their firm to produce more. They may react by moving to a new firm that has a polished recruiting strategy that seems far more attractive. However, the advisor has never been proactive and plateaued early on in their career. They got here by not building or adopting a system to more efficiently manage their clients and practice. Clients were never segmented and called or asked to meet on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. These clients typically were the ones initiating the conversation, which often put the advisor on their back foot. Without an established relationship, the inevitable death spiral will occur when switching firms. Why does this happen? Clients choose to work with the advisor, not with the firm that he or she is affiliated with. Wirehouse advisors: you know it’s true. Every individual is compelled to look out for number one and, should they receive poor service, they will make a change. So, when advisors make the change for a ‘new beginning’ or ‘upgraded platform’, clients exit stage left. A Cautionary Tale When consulting with advisors during a transition we always ask, “What does your client service model look like?” We tell them that they don’t need to answer the question to anyone but themselves, but the answer will affect client retention. There are other factors that impact client retention during a transition, but there is no other single factor that has a more profound negative or positive effect than how an advisor services their clients. Period. We recently counseled an advisor who was moving and one week prior to the transition date, he asked me if it would be okay for him to speak with his compliance officer. According to the advisor, this individual was trusted and held in very high regard. He thought the compliance officer could make his outgoing departure smooth. For the record, we strongly advised him not to share this information and in the end against his better judgment, he told his secret. Luckily for him, this particular incident only resulted in one lost pay period of fees and commissions, but it’s still not an easy pill to swallow. However, it could have been much worse. Outside of your spouse/partner and attorney (and new firm!) never tell anyone about your move, as it could result in immediate termination. Retention Rates Remain High The majority of advisors do subscribe to tremendously effective service models and we often see client or asset retention as high as 85% or higher. This retention begins years before an advisor is even thinking of changing firms, as the advisor’s business practices help cater to clients for life. They become a trusted financial consultant and occasional poor investment performance results don’t cast a shadow on the relationship. Having taken my own book of business through a firm change, and then helping dozens of advisors and teams make a move, we consistently see client retention between 70% and 90% or higher. More often than not, the lower retention rate is by design as they shed clients they don’t want. A Tale of Success One of my favorite stories, told so much more eloquently than I can, comes from an advisor in Ohio. He left a wirehouse to affiliate with an independent broker/dealer. Let’s call him John. So, John segmented his book A through D, as so many advisors do. Upon resigning, his ‘A’ clients received nothing short of white glove service to ensure retention. The ‘B’ group received very close to the same level of attention, as they were also very important to his business. John mailed one letter to his ‘C’ clients and if they did not respond to the letter, he let them go. His ‘D’ clients (the ones he definitely didn’t want) were never notified of his move! The day after he moved firms, John said he was more profitable than ever and, more importantly, he was now running a highly efficient practice. Final Thoughts At the end of the day, Advisors should focus on a better experience for their clients and the retention will follow. As long as you are maintaining a close relationship with them, clients will be loyal to you, rather than the firm you are affiliated with. Whether you stay with your current firm or not, client happiness is the core metric that dictates an advisor’s success or failure. Never forget that.

3,Building Genuine Relationships for Potential Business Growth,2017-10-18T16:56:25+00:00,"Wednesday, October 18th, 2017 at 4:56 pm.",Dan Overbey,http://ifpartners.com/building-genuine-relationships-potential-business-growth/,"In my line of work at IFP, I often have to build relationships with some unfamiliar faces. This means I’m constantly breaking out of my comfort zone, having some off-topic discussions, and turning those conversations into fruitful business arrangements. There’s no secret sauce or some mystical influence I have over other individuals – it’s just me and my decades of experience as a financial professional. Whether you can offer the other person a new concept, strategy, or the keys to help unlock their hopes and dreams, a genuine relationship is the spark that ignites that fire. Humanizing the Professional If you initially communicate through email with an individual, don’t take their initial rigid speech to heart. Most people sound a bit mechanical when they type, which is simply a product of people meticulously picking apart their own writing before sending off a professional communication. We all do it – don’t overthink their overthinking. Remember, you’re just trying to get a face-to-face conversation rolling as quickly as possible. When you finally get that in-person opportunity, treat the person sitting behind the desk as a human being. They have their own dreams, aspirations, and business goals. Before throwing them some hard sell technique you learned in business school, slow down, gauge their personality, and get a feel for their beliefs. This helps later when you need to find common ground that will act as a catalyst to kick start your relationship. Be Personable Just as you can acknowledge them as a living, breathing person, you need to be one as well. While you should respect their position as a professional, a close relationship can only make your life easier. This closeness will allow you to openly communicate with them as issues or opportunities arise, potentially enabling you to more easily reach a reasonable and productive conclusion. Sharing Common Goals Without a common business goal, there’s no point to a professional relationship. Now, before you call up that contact you didn’t click with and burn the bridge, know that each connection established is a possible opportunity. Even if it doesn’t work out with that person, someone in their network might be looking for a financial advisor. Add that old connection on LinkedIn, ask them how their kids are doing from time to time and stay engaged. As long as you find professionals that share your values and/or business goals, it’s worth staying connected. Schedule Some Time Should you start working together, it’s important to spend time with them on a regular basis. Whether they accept your offers or not, the gesture does not go unnoticed. Be Helpful…But Not Too Helpful If you’re like me, I naturally enjoy helping people. While this can help build a stronger bond with stakeholders in your new environment, people can take advantage of your good will. Financial advising is also about getting paid for your advice, so next time they want you to look over their entire financial situation, you might consider telling them to make an appointment. Dealing with Difficult People I know I’ve focused mostly on the scenario in which you’re universally accepted into the new workplace with open arms so far, so let’s look into the opposite scenario. Sometimes professionals don’t want friends. Sometimes it’s only about the money and passion for their job is a distant second. In these scenario, it’s still possible to build a genuine relationship, but it’s one based purely on gaining a competitive advantage or generating more revenue. Our ultimate goal is to generate more business, so it’s nothing to be upset about. In fact, certain personalities might find this sort of arrangement far more appealing and no one can fault you for that. Closing Thoughts Every business relationship requires attention in one way or another, but as we adapt to changes in the financial services industry, it’s more important than ever to network. While it might be uncomfortable at first, being charismatic can help you achieve greater success than you have ever known. Also, as my old boss used to say, “The worst they can say is no.”"
4,Blog Series: The Truth About Branding for Financial Advisors (Part 2 of 3),2017-10-10T16:09:01+00:00,"Tuesday, October 10th, 2017 at 4:09 pm.",Sean Brennan,http://ifpartners.com/blog-series-truth-branding-financial-advisors-part-2-3/,"In this series about branding for financial advisors, we explore some blunders, steps to improve an advisor’s brand presence, and – for the uninitiated – where to get started. If you missed it, check out Part 1 of the series where we discussed investing in your brand and asking the right questions. This time we’re going to dive a bit deeper into what it means to be an independent financial advisor and building a brand around that experience. As we always say in the IFP Design Group, your brand is not your logo. Let’s continue our journey into branding with the next branding truths for financial advisors. Truth 3: You must have a marketing plan (in addition to) a business plan before launching your independent advisory practice. Whether they’re concrete or abstract, every successful company starts with a goal-focused roadmap and a plan of action for achieving those goals. It’s easy to buy a book of business to kick start a business. In addition, some organic growth may occur through referrals and word-of-mouth, but what about the growth that could possibly be achieved through a developed marketing plan? Well, let’s start by answering a few questions. Why is this important? For some, it might seem pretty obvious that a marketing plan is important. Unfortunately, in our experience of working with advisors, it’s not all that common in this industry, especially during the whirlwind of establishing a practice. The same can be said for advisors or advisor firms that have been in business for many years. We get it – after spending the majority of your day grinding away earning new business and dealing with existing clients, the last thing you want to do is exert more effort creating a solid marketing plan. However, there will come a day when you will want to generate new business through marketing initiatives, which is why it’s so important to start as soon as possible. I didn’t have a plan before. Why do I need one now? We get it. You haven’t needed a plan before and you aren’t starving to death. With that said, there’s a big difference between surviving and flourishing. Just like the other divisions at IFP, we are constantly encouraging advisors to reach beyond their comfort zone to build a legacy of prosperity and greater success. Another common preconceived notion is along the lines of business growth and generating new leads (prospective clients). Our team frequently speaks with advisors seeking to freshen up their client list as their careers have picked up and the most common feedback we get goes a little something like this: “I acquire most clients by word-of-mouth or through referrals. Why should I look elsewhere?” While it’s certainly a good way to generate new business, what happens if that well dries up? Are you diversified enough to withstand the loss of a referral network? Especially for small advisory firms, it’s incredibly dangerous to rely on such a piecemeal strategy to sustainably grow your company. What tools do I need? This is the part where you expect us to say you need to spend at least $50,000 to $100,000 a year on marketing and advertising to get anywhere. That couldn’t be further from the truth. As you may have discovered on your own, the Internet is a great place to find business growth, but advisors often have trouble navigating this unchartered territory. Our internal team has identified a number of completely FREE tools that can help grow your business online with minimal effort. Google Analytics Do you have a website? Are you tracking the visitors that come to your website? If not, we have a good place to start. Google Analytics allows you to keep track of users’ activity while on your website. This data can be used to optimize your customer retention rate, improve conversion rates, and create content that’s more relevant to your target audience. There are many other applications for this information, but we recommend you start simple and work your way up from there. Get Started with Google Analytics >> Google My Business If you have a website, you’re on Google. How a website displays on Google is an entirely different matter. By claiming your Google My Business account, you gain significant control of your web appearance. Verify the firm’s business address, phone number, name, hours of operation, and photography with ease. Get Started with Google My Business >> Bing Places for Business Bing Places for Business is Microsoft’s answer to Google My Business. For them, it’s competition; for you, it’s opportunity. Claim your Bing listing and get to work molding your company’s online presence. Get Started with Bing Places for Business >> Business Citations Remember the days when a fat phone book landed on your front door stuffed full of advertisements with little numbers inside? Then, in the very back, you’d find the coveted yellow pages where services were listed out for your convenience. For those that don’t recall, this was a primitive version of Googling for a service you needed. Coincidentally, there are now many Internet sources that function the same way as the old yellow pages. Better yet, they’re free! Our very own Max Griendling created a list of online citations and a brief guide to get you started. Before proceeding, we wanted to note that you need a website for this to work. Get Started with Internet Citations >> Your Mind Clients aren’t dumb. They know there are options at their disposal to get free advice and tools to invest on their own terms. Despite this, they trust in your experience, background, and education to make the right decision with their money. Never forget that you are the most important tool at a client’s disposal. How do I get started? Avoid Superman Syndrome We know you’re confident in your abilities, but you can’t do this alone. Especially if you are struggling to market yourself, find a consultant that can help before diving into uncharted waters. Before You Begin If you choose to speak to a marketing professional, begin by jotting down a list of competitors. Be sure to include why you think they’re competition, what they do different or better than you, how you differ from them, and develop a persona of your current and target clientele. In addition, you will want to perform a traditional SWOT analysis, which helps you identify your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Whatever you can get out of your head and on paper will help a marketing consultant better assist you. Establish Goals What do you want to achieve with your marketing efforts? Even if you aren’t sure if these goals are correct or if they can be achieved, write them down. A marketer will leverage this information to identify the correct tools, services, resources, and budget to get the job done. They can also help you prioritize and refine these goals, making sure they are attainable and within reason. Make a Plan and Commit Work with your marketing expert to establish milestones and a thorough plan for reaching those milestones. Once the milestones and tasks are developed, set deadlines to complete each task, and immediately input those deadlines into your work calendar. You’re more likely to commit the time to work on your plan if it’s on your calendar. It will take a lot of time and hard work to reach your milestones, but it will pay off if you are consistent. If you’re looking to get a fresh start in 2018, now is the time to start building out a plan. Truth 4: As an independent financial advisor, you’re no longer just an advisor. You’re a business owner and entrepreneur. Start thinking of yourself as one! One day you’re a wirehouse advisor, and the next you’re building a business from the ground up. Whether you knew it or not, this is the day you decided to become an entrepreneur. This also means you’re responsible for marketing your own business, which for some is a strange, uncharted world. In marketing terms, this means you need to order business cards, create a pitch deck, maintain a website, set appointments, run analytics reports on your clients, and more. So, if you don’t have personal experience of having ever owned, operated, or run a business, put your learning cap and seat belt on; you’re about to hit some turbulence. For example, just as a professionally trained chef can cook amazing meals, that doesn’t always equate to operating a successful, profitable and marketable restaurant. Just think about how many restaurants you’ve seen that serve delicious meals, but wind up closing their doors after only a few months of operation. Preparing for Your Entrepreneurial Journey? First and foremost, it’s time to change your entire mindset because you, sir or madam, are a business owner and entrepreneur! It’s time to make a strategic and intentional shift that will give you the best possible chance of success, by making some simple changes to your mindset: It’s going to take vision, time, and a strong commitment to shift your mindset. To avoid becoming overwhelmed, take it one step at a time. Start by implementing one single point of change per month in your operations, processes, or mindset depending on your level of comfort. Track your progress by taking notes on your completed tasks, on what worked for you, what didn’t, and any adjustments you’ve made at the end of each month.

5,Learnings from Watching the Death March of the Fiduciary Rule,2017-09-14T10:51:40+00:00,"Thursday, September 14th, 2017 at 10:51 am.",Kim Shaw Elliott,http://ifpartners.com/learnings-watching-death-march-fiduciary-rule/,"Major parts of the Department of Labor’s (“DOL(’s)”) new fiduciary rule may- ultimately- oh, so sssslowly- meet their demise. We among the industry have watched in agony with each new twist and turn, spent countless hours reviewing and analyzing the rule and may now wonder what value has been gleaned from all the trauma. Here are a few thoughts about what we have learned: Sound Practices Prevail The transition relief from full implementation of the fiduciary rule requires that a fiduciary rendering investment advice comply with the impartial conduct standard. That requires acting only in the best interest of the client, receiving no more than reasonable compensation and making no misrepresentations about services and fees. No formal written policies, procedures or contracts are required. On its face, this looks simple. Remember: no formal written policies, procedures or contracts are required. Closer evaluation reveals some gaps, however. How do you know you are acting in the best interest of a client if you have no policies or procedures to guide you? Can you tell what is reasonable compensation for services without benchmarking other fees? Might a client believe that you have lied about what services you will perform if you do not describe those services in a well- written agreement? While not required, having clear policies and procedures, benchmarking your fees and maintaining clearly understandable contracts simply makes sense. Each is a best practice that is likely to increase understanding among parties and to produce happy results. This is nothing new. Follow the Money- Always Rollovers are at the core of the fiduciary rule. Retail investment expenses and advisor compensation for an individual’s account will routinely be higher than under a comparable but institutionally priced investment inside a plan. It has been a long-standing rule, however, that an advisor cannot use his or her authority as a fiduciary to gain additional compensation. These transfers therefore create the ideal setting for a conflict of interest. Deep Throat’s caution to Bob Woodward consequently applies. “Follow the money.” If the path leads to more money than keeping the money in the plan, you may have a problem. Investigate and correct as needed. Good Forms Are Terribly Difficult to Draft but Quite Useful Many of us have spent the last several months engaged in the arduous task of drafting new forms to support recommendations to switch from a commission-based plan to an advisory arrangement or to rollover assets from an employer-sponsored plan to an IRA or rollover assets between IRAs. The options available to a client seem endless and difficult to explain. When properly completed, however, a good form can be a thing of beauty. A well-crafted form serves as an educational tool, in and of itself. Written in plain English, it can guide a client through each element of the complex array of available options. This type of disclosure permits the client to make an informed choice, even when the information may be painful to provide. Once completed, a form becomes a permanent record of the educational process, the recommendations made and what advice was accepted by the client. That’s a nice thing to have on hand in the event of an examination by a regulator. More importantly, it creates an understandable reference document for your client. The Move of One Regulator to the Front of an Issue Does Not Motivate Another to Take its Stance The industry has been clamoring for decades for clarity about what fiduciary duties are owed when recommending transfers from plans. The DOL first released its groundbreaking guidance about rollovers in Advisory Opinion 2005-23A, leaving many issues in doubt. Many practitioners hoped that much of the ambiguity would be resolved by the Pension Reform Act of 2006. Unfortunately, new ERISA Section 408(g) was found by many to be unworkable and few advisors have utilized this PRA exemption. FINRA was slow to come to the party but announced its guidance in 2013 with Regulatory Notice 13-45. Among other things, it clearly specified factors to be considered in making a rollover decision. The DOL’s first attempt at drafting the new fiduciary rule came in 2010, but it withdrew that work in the face of industry outrage. The current rule was published as a final rule April 8, 2016, which became partially effective June 7, 2017, with the survival of the remainder of the provisions now uncertain. Despite all this activity, we have yet to hear from the SEC, the agency charged with primary responsibility for regulating investment advice. Chairman Jay Clayton released a statement June 1 of this year, conceding that, “the Department of Labor’s Fiduciary Rule may have significant effects on retail investors and entities regulated by the SEC. It also may have broader effects on our capital markets. Many of these matters fall within the SEC’s mission of protecting investors; maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitating capital formation.” With that, he created a new email box for the public to respond to specific questions. There is no definitive commitment as to when the chief regulator may provide any guidance on this important issue. Data and Statistics Cannot Change a Firmly Held Political View Much has been written about the thousands of pages, hours of testimony and reams of published studies that have been expended in bringing the fiduciary rule to its current state of unreadiness. The undercurrent of the regulation is clear: its authors fundamentally believed that the industry has taken unfair advantage of retirement investors and needs to be changed. An EBSA News Release, issued April 6, 2016, included bold face bullet points, charging that “Conflicts of Interest in Retirement Advice Are Hurting the Middle Class,” “President Obama Is Cracking Down on Conflicts of Interest,” “Conflicts of Interest in Retirement Advice Cost Savers Billions of Dollars.” The entry of a new administration brought with it a new political view. The DOL’s the web page for the news release just quoted now includes this proviso, “Please note: As of January 20, 2017, information in some news releases may be out of date or not reflect current policies.” And so the stance of our regulator has changed. Stay tuned.

6,"Do You Give Investment Advice to IRAs? Then Take Note, the Fiduciary Rule Means You.",2017-06-21T13:01:46+00:00,"Wednesday, June 21st, 2017 at 1:01 pm.",Kim Shaw Elliott,http://ifpartners.com/give-investment-advice-iras-take-note-fiduciary-rule-means/,"President and ERISA Counsel, IFP Plan Advisors We have heard about the DOL’s new fiduciary rule ad infinitum. However, some advisors may continue to miss the message that the reach of the rule extends well beyond traditional, employer-sponsored retirement plans. Anyone giving investment advice for a fee to an IRA, SIMPLE, SEP or similar account is an ERISA fiduciary under the new rule. That likely means every IFP advisor. “Why is this significant?” you might ask. When acting as an advisor, rather than a registered representative, you have always been a fiduciary, as defined by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. You are accustomed to acting in your clients’ best interests. Serving as a fiduciary is a key differentiator in how you approach the individuals that entrust you with their financial well-being, compared to a registered representative that must merely offer what is suitable. With that said, becoming an ERISA fiduciary in addition to being an Advisers Act fiduciary brings new responsibilities, exposes you to higher scrutiny of your actions, and imposes a new standard of care. How You Get Paid May Create a Conflict of Interest What is a conflict of interest? As with all things in this industry, just follow the money. The new rule includes compensation that is not “level” as a conflict of interest. Unlevel compensation is any form of payment that might vary with the recommendation you make. The brokerage industry is rife with unlevel payment arrangements. Different mutual funds pay different amounts of compensation; sometimes a registered representative might direct a client to different compensation levels within the same mutual fund. Stocks pay commissions that might be different than bonds. Recommending any particular investment might enable the financial professional to receive more money than recommending an alternative. Any of these presents a conflict of interest. Also conflicted is any payment from a third party. Think revenue sharing and 12b-1s. The ability to withstand conflicts of interest is vastly different under the Advisers Act and ERISA. Under the Advisers Act, an advisor must disclose all conflicts of interests so that a fully informed client may make an intelligent decision for him or herself about whether to proceed with your recommendation, even if it is made in the face of a conflict of interest. By moving ahead with the advice, the client has waived any real or potential conflicts that were disclosed. Not so under ERISA. Any conflict of interest, as defined by ERISA, is a prohibited transaction. Like the name suggests, if the advisor has a conflict, that transaction cannot proceed; it is prohibited. There is no waiver of an ERISA-prohibited transaction. The only way to engage in the conflicted conduct is to comply with a prohibited transaction exemption. An Exemption Is Needed to Resolve an ERISA Conflict of Interest Enter the now infamous Best Interest Contract (“BIC”) exemption to permit the prohibited, conflicted compensation. Unlevel compensation such as commissions and third party payments such as 12b-1s is allowed if the full conditions of the BIC are satisfied. Compliance with all but one of the many onerous conditions of the BIC exemption has been postponed until 2018 so we will not repeat them here. We at IFP do not plan to take advantage of the full BIC exemption because we believe that it is not needed. Fee-based arrangements such as ours are not considered conflicted because an asset-based fee or a flat dollar fee does not vary with the investments an advisor might recommend. We also do not accept payments from third parties. Once you have established an advisory relationship, you are paid the same amount, regardless of what action you suggest to your client, so you do not give conflicted investment advice. Accordingly, your current arrangements with stand-alone IRAs should be able to continue without change because you do not need an exemption. Should you give advice that results in additional compensation to you, an exemption is required. Rollovers present the classic examples of potential conflicts of interest. You might be paid 25 bps for helping the plan fiduciary select the investment menu for the plan but charge 100 bps to advise an IRA that you suggested the participant roll into. Each fee is a level fee but your compensation is not the same under each arrangement. The DOL interprets the conflict of interest rules to include situations where your pay may increase as a result of your advice, whether that be from something to more something- or even from zero to something. The prohibition is not limited to advice relating to an employer-sponsored plan. Your advice to take any rollover is itself fiduciary investment advice so receiving any compensation as a result of that recommendation can be deemed to be a conflict. IFP expects to rely on a short form exemption for level fee arrangements such as these that might create a conflict. A full BIC contract would not be required. Just like compliance with the full BIC, all but one of the simplified conditions of the Level Fee Fiduciary exemption have been delayed until next year. Full Compliance with the New Rule May Be Delayed but New Forms Will Support Best Practices The condition that has not been delayed for either the full BIC or the Level Fee Fiduciary exemption is the obligation to satisfy the impartial conduct standards. These standards may be distilled to three requirements: Act in the best interest of the client, Receive no more than reasonable compensation, and Make no misleading statements. Upon first glance, these standards may seem obvious. Look closer, however. Do you know how to prove that you acted in your client’s best interest? What must you do to comply with that standard? How do you determine what is reasonable pay for an IRA? What is an actionable misleading statement? You must meet the impartial conduct standards, effective June 9, 2017. IFP will help you create and maintain a record of each of the important criteria. While it is not specifically required that you maintain records of the recommendations you make, we believe that it has always been a best practice to do so. Memories fade, facts change and the comfort level a client may have with an advisor shifts over time, so recording the factors you considered at the time of guiding your client is indispensable. We will help you do that by requiring new forms to document your recommendations for: Rollovers from a qualified plan to an IRA, Rollovers between IRAs and similar accounts, and Transfers from commission-based to advisory arrangements. The Next Steps Consider moving all your business to a conflict conscious advisory arrangement. Attend our training sessions. Carefully review and then use the new forms. Ask questions about anything about which you are unclear. Continue what you have always done; act in your clients’ best interests."
