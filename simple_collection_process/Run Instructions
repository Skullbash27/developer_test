	* For System Path, type "export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$JSOUP_HOME/jsoup-1.11.2.jar:." in the command line

5) Now download commons-csv.jar from the following link --> https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/download_csv.cgi

	*In that link click "commons-csv-1.5-bin.zip" under Binaries to download the file
	*Once downloaded, Extract the contents in the zip file into a seperate folder in the system
	*Among the contents extracted there should be a file named commons-csv-1.5.jar extracted, keep note of that

6) Now set the common-csv environment variables by setting COMMONCSV_HOME and System Path

	* For Commons-csv HOME, type "export COMMONCSV_HOME=<<Location where the commons-csv-1.5.jar file is saved>>" in the command line
	* For System Path, type "export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$COMMONCSV_HOME/commons-csv-1.5.jar:." in the command line

7) Now in the same terminal window, change directory ('cd') to the location of the SimpleCollection.java file

8) Now type the command "javac SimpleCollection.java"

	*After executing the command a file "SimpleCollection.class" will be created

9) Finally type the command "java SimpleCollection" to run the program

10) After the program is run, the csv file "Ouput.csv" will be created in the directory with the required extracted information from the webpage "http://ifpartners.com/cut-the-wire/"
