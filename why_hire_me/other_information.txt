My favourite programming language is Java simply because its strongly typed and well structured. It also has strong documentation and is well supported in the online community with an extremely vast pool of developers. I use the Eclipse IDE to code in Java which I prefer due to its Intellisense functionality and its feature of keeping everything organised including importing external libraries for the application being developed. For Python, I use gedit which is a Linux based text editor and I mainly use Python for quick scriting purposes which could go from automating routines to rapid prototyping.
