Dear Jordan,

I am writing this letter to confirm my interest in the Software Engineering position at Independent Financial Partners. I have over 3 years of working experience in the software field from which I have 1.5 years of experience working with Java and 2 years of experience with Python. I also have about 1 year of experience with SQL. These experiences has made me gain strong knowledge of Object Oriented Programming languages and SQL which I believe are the requirements for the position.

Over the years, experience has taught me that passion for the job coupled with perseverance is key to the success of an employee at any work place. I like solving problems and I believe there are multiple ways to solve any problem. I believe that I have the ability work within a team as well as function independently whenever required which I have learnt through my previous work experience. I have a strong desire to keep learning as I go and I’m very passionate about software and programming. Therefore, I believe I would be the right fit for the position and am hoping I will be considered for it.

Thank you,
Austin

P.S - I have used Java as my language of choice in the simple_refactoring_exercise
