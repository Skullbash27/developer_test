Notes:-

1) I refactored the "substituteForCode" method in the CodeReplacer.java file.

2) I removed integer variables which is used for splitting the 'template' String from the template.html file.

3) I also removed the unneccessary String variables which was used to store substrings of the 'template' String.

4) I replaced them by using a much more straight forward find and replace parser with the '.replaceAll' method for the String, that finds a particular String in this case "%CODE% and "%ALTCODE% and replaces it with the given string.

5) This improves spatial complexity and saves memory, as space is not reserved for the 'int' and 'String' additional variables.

6) I also made a small modification in the 'substitute' method where I removed the splitting of the reqID with the '-' and added it to the "substituteForCode" private method so that this process can be encapsulated from the user who wants to use the 'substitute' method which is public

7) CodeReplacerTest.java has not been changed in any manner.

8) Both Tests pass successfully on execution.


P.S -> Refactoring this Code was done in the Linux Operating System (Ubuntu) with Java 1.8 installed.
